# SPARQL Endpoint

This is a project for Semantic Web to send queries to a fuseki API endpoint containing a dataset.

## Installation

The fuseki server must be first activated by running the ```fuseki-server.bat``` which will start up the server on ```localhost:3030```. 

Navigate to the endpoint on a browser (Firefox, Chrome, Brave, etc.) and you'll arrive to the welcome page.

From there, create a dataset and give it any name you want.

Upload the file ```dataset\Values-Map-Ontology-RDF-XML.owl``` to the dataset.

Next import the folder ```spaqrlendpointproject``` as a maven project as import from external sources.
